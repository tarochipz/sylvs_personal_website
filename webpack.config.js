// webpack is a code/module bundler for JS apps - it takes code and makes it usable in a browser.
// when webpack processes an app, it builds a 'dependency graph' which maps code and assets the project needs and generates one or more 'bundles'.
// A 'bundle' is a group of connected code that has been compiled for the browser.

// there are 3 things webpack needs to know
